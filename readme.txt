Database:
We use postgresql and dbeaver to construct and manage our database

Website:
We use Node.js to build our website and connect it to our database with npm package 'pg'.

At this stage, our website supports users to either enter queries directly or select, update, insert, and delete from one table directly with boxes for information that user would like to enter for database indexing.

Particularly, for user name and business name, '' needs to be included.
