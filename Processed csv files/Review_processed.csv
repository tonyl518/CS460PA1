-0ky7usnYDVMB8lQfc1KMg,bF7KQ6AQK5rBS7aOFKtlWg,6GJM8bWV3m2cOYPjDjohJA,4,3.5 STARSFOOD: I love my sandwiches, and Dilly's always satisfies me. The sandwiches are pretty big. I like the Smokey Mountain because any sandwich with bacon in it is twice as good as those without! I think you get a free cookie with your sandwich, not sure though. PRICE: Around $7 for a sandwichATMOSPHERE: Nothing amazing, but definitely good enough to sit down at.SKINNY: For those of you who love your sandwiches for lunch, go to Dilly's Deli and you shouldn't be disappointed.
-0lg54ca28LapEeDFQ1u5g,50hOEQ2OutvIxrMjNml5bA,MRpr7424VPPicEVPcj7RCg,1,Poor knock off of the Persian Room down the way on Scottsdale Rd. I heard they even stole the menu and recipes although they don't seem able to follow the recipes very well. The food is a nice try but still something is missing. Don't waste your time the original is not far away go to the Persian Room instead
-0Mu1tRn2Q7w8RQrQMpZmQ,RtwOc-n_RkiUuDGaNfCsNw,3qMUN6NGDq1GWtAJSuvXIQ,3,Ahh cheesesteaks, what a sensitive topic. Well I feel that before I start I have to state that I AM a Philly native. I'm not saying my review/opinion holds more weight than that of others, but basically, it does. Forefather's is good to go in my book! I tried their the original and it did bring a slight smile to my face when I bit into it. The shredded style of steak isn't my choice (see my Steve's Prince of Steaks review) but other than that
-0Myc1sl-cDHjv3djKcEYw,_4_84uCAFDI2VHHEQz5f2g,MIFdtqqbw3bw4YRf88GFQQ,1,Their current ad in Echo says they are open Sunday. Brought a group of friends, drove 50 miles roundtrip, to find a sign on the door saying they are not open on Sundays for the summer. Suggest their advertisements match their hours of operations.
-0Nf2dFF1YSIuf7y-aRdpQ,DGtOkc0KNTyK8rDkmsPNYw,WFs7wNFMnCMu9KepJIIVuQ,4,Pleasant surprise. This place is alot bigger than it appears from the outside and the atomosphere is very inviting and comfortable. If felt that for the money the quality of food was above average the the service was excellent. I would recommend their special dinners that include the salad, steak an potatoe - very good value.
-0pEJxa2cqXZLjNixaNlWA,Xq1FtLSV54Spf-HfONc1aA,PNS9z4aFDbfhpIsHCfNvNg,5,Delicious Donuts! Great service. My new neighborhood donut shop. I'll be back for the #1 combo - two donuts & a coffee. Perfect.
-0PFqDCvbEbWGQLXl52ARw,c0RSs2KYK5Y-ZlSrNq9LyA,FGZkbk4G9lUfBrT4BlsyGg,5,This is truthfully the best sushi place in town! when your there dont forget to ask for the secret menu.....
-0Pu4xCk7ymHKoIOGLT2Nw,SqWx6Xc7UygGNQ2LtUCXsA,KI4sBf9jWLs4aGm_mIsFQA,4,I've been to Mando's about four more times since my review...not much has changed as far as the quality of their food goes.  The horchata continues to be great.  So are the crispy little tacos.  I haven't ventured too far out of the box, pretty much sticking with tacos, burritos, and chimis.  Its just something about the heftines of the chimi that you can't help but smile about.  Service continues to be friendly.  Only thing I'd like to see is an update for the interior, but money is tight, I'm sure.
-0pwV4stztsYF58Ig3lCLQ,bcBMAa0UQpNLFvvdZ4dxtQ,i3xyCKYLeqxA-2e5pZxPWQ,4,Not bad for the first gay club i've been to out here in the desert. If you're a lady, the queens take care of you here. Didn't seem to have to wait in line for the bathroom nor really wait for a drink at the bar no matter how crowded it was that night. It seems the cocktail servers walk around with tin buckets of jello shots, manties showcasing the BS West logo & cute hair. Drink chips @ the bar, non-Scottsdale drink pricing which was a ++. As soon as this spot hit max. capacity
-0qAQRCRpvoUPnPKRLlUrg,srElnEXI8Qq7DpHquTI8HQ,8wTya9Ijcf775vSofnfdGw,3,I've been coming to Oaxaca for a couple of years.  Before the remodel it was little more than a greasy spoon with great mexican fare.  After the remodel, I felt like I needed to dress up a little, the place is so classy!Luckily the food is still great!  I ordered the chicken soup, which was delicious, albeit sort of cold.  Very savory though.  I would definitely order it again, and next time a bigger bowl.Although we didn't sit there, the new bar looks like it would offer a good time.  Lots of tvs and a welcoming atmosphere.  It might be a good place to watch a game or meet men watching a game. :)  The last time I was here though...it took 20 minutes to get our tab...on a very very slow Saturday afternoon.  We had to ask several times.  But I will definitely go back as the food is so darn good.
-0qzrNtTgoJrhP81A8Dd2w,_lanRtzQGRkbhd2b6pQleQ,s1Skvk3sRkTHdp4V3cK8XQ,4,Do you want to go for a hike by yourself to just think? This is the place. Do you need to take the kids somewhere to run around? Come here. Want to show visitors how rocks look in AZ? They will love taking pictures. If you grew up here, you know Papago Park by sight. Take time to explore it, and tread lightly!
-0R2SzVUPfLCQ4t5F536-g,X_sZ5PxFj6K0_TOOV4xKoA,F66ALXcvZJcpGMbJ90zS8g,4,One of the cleanest libraries in the East Valley!Staff is very helpful, even if you have to wait in a line. Many options available for patrons. Nice little book store in front to purchase books. Bathrooms are clean and well maintained. We love coming to this library!
-0SalvsuPMbEoKlkLEeqlg,8D_e6Oc4eZdRSnK0_v8sGw,rQ5pqYUrzZSK-uuQ_ZMEeg,1,I never thought it could be done - customer service so mediocre that it turns me against a building housing thousands of books! The only thing brick and mortar booksellers have over the net is SERVICE. Ok, AND instant availability in hard copy but then again, I can instantly download so who needs a hard copy. Well, I do because I'm one of those types but I'd rather wait a month than give you a dime. Why?Dear Staff: When you scowl at me (if acknowledge me at all) and then answer the phone and go to look for that customer's item while I was waiting first, why...I'm outta there. This has happened more than once. Also - Heaven help the person who tries to return anything here. I'll barely wish upon this one star that you get it together because this isn't the first time you've disappointed me. It's a far drive to my local book seller but I'm willing to go the distance - something every employee should consider doing for each customer - especially the one standing right in front of her.
-0SwYJMBR_aNfRL1tZ1L5A,QNUpPMDpIo6gkLNNnOPXMw,GPPHDWEZGjiw777_iTOJ1w,1,We ordered our bed about a week before Christmas and were quoted a delivery time of 8 weeks. Our bed arrived the first week of May. Their sales rep failed to tell us they shut their factory down in China for a MONTH in January extending that 8 week quote an additional month. If we knew this at the time we placed the order in December, we would have looked elsewhere. We were told this only after calling to check on the status of the bed around Feb/March-ish. We were told we could cancel the order if we were unhappy with the wait time. No discount or apology was extended to us. They did offer free delivery and set up, which they then tried to pass off again on us when the bed finally arrived.We had to refer their sales person back to their email stating that they would cover this for the massive inconvenience they caused us. I love their furniture, the quality of the bed is great but based on their service I would not recommend Parnian unless you don't mind sleeping on a mattress on the floor for 5 months.
-0Tltr0ZYM35fp6FBf9hCg,CqhsIZ7TzCfJTrZqg5-gqQ,Lp_Ykqfbv5Q-oyGYlMGJRg,4,Upon first impressions, not that impressed. After a few minutes, I'm in love. The bartneders qere amazing, hooking it up with much needed shots and a free beer when he forgot to change the keg. The bartenders love to joke around and it seems like there are a lot of regulars. Always a good sign...I would give this place five stars if I had the food, they have tomato soup. Alas, I was out with the biggest tool in N Scottsdale and apparenty I didn't deserve a meal with this horrible date because I wanted to leave so I could watch It's Always Sunny. Best decision of my life!Also
-0VlFh_H5YIInSvoFbYMrQ,KGX7O-_WqOIy9o7u9NOa9A,V7pppn-r6tL_Yb2_msQQFw,5,One of my goals coming into Phoenix was to find a great, local Mexican or Latin-influenced place for lunch one day. Mission accomplished.I got a two-taco combo with horchata. For one, I picked up the apparently legendary carne asada, and the other, barbacoa. The combo comes with a side of rice and beans. I even got guac on the side, and there was three more salsas coming with my meal. So maybe I did pay $12 for lunch, but... holy cow.I knew I was in for a good time when I sampled the rice. It's wonderful with a bit of fresh cilantro and lime will do to a side dish. I turned my attention to the beans, and they were also not overlooked; what's the secret ingredient? Bacon fat? Salt pork? Whatever it is, I thoroughly enjoyed the beans.The horchata I got with my meal was excellent! They use more cinnamon than I'm used to, but it wasn't hyper-sweet and was just what I needed on another 100 degree day.The tacos were fresh, served with a lime, and perfect. I liked the barbacoa   since it had a nice flavor from the marinade, but the carne asada was the star of this meal; not overcooked, not bland, not rubbery, not any other slew of adjectives that come to mind when I think of bad beef. It was juicy, and bright, and meaty, and perfect.The sauces were wonderfully complimentary and I found myself wishing that I had chips as an excuse to eat up all the sauce (including the grilled green pepper / onion/ chile sauce that turned into a four-alarm in my mouth).I didn't get a chance to do dessert since I was filled to the brim with what I had already ordered. But I find myself really hoping I go back to try it.I can't speak for authentic Mexican food places, since I haven't been to many (or to Mexico). But I can speak to the food served at Mesquite; it's a great bargain!
-0w03g1PeeAa4LbLouaaiA,xm8F51qKjx0cfdOSukTDng,HIo5BcY39kYGOY6XNVrEdw,5,We just finished a 3-day weekend at the resort and I cannot say enough about the facility or the staff , so I'll try to hit the highlights:The pool deck staff are outstanding.  They are friendly and fast.The pool and the hot tub are clean and both at the perfect temperatures.The food is phenomenal.  I highly recommend the bento boxes and all the salads.  I would also suggest selecting the asian inspired creations.  The only average selection we had was the kobe beef hot dog.  The spa is spotless and the staff is superb.  Both my fiancee and I reported to each other it was one of the top three messages we had ever had.  I would recommend asking for Tim C.The rooms are tastefully appointed and the bed, sheets and towels are deluxe.I am already planning another trip to the Sanctuary.Enjoy!
-0XD6oxbyqmfk6NP4bLUDw,MXOdsPTLQPsQK9hUq01DWg,TFoC8qQCI2VfQe3rB0Q0ng,2,We were told that this was a good place to go with our 2 kids.  We arrived at 5:45 on a saturday evening, and they were slammed.  The service was slow, I am pretty sure our waitress had WAY too many tables.  I got the bacon blue burger and it was good, although they overcooked, I asked for medium and it was well.  My husband liked his southwestern wrap, until he picked up the second half and discovered a hair on the plate.  Once our waitress returned she immediately took it away and asked him if he wanted anything else, but at that point he lost his appetite.  They did take the $ off the bill.  It took our waitress at least 10 minutes to bring the check once we asked for it, then we paid partly with cash and partly with a card.  We instructed that she take the cash off the bill and put the rest on the card, she returns, cash gone, and full amount on the bill.  Now we stand around another 10 minutes waiting for her to return.  Finally get it all taken care of and get out of there. Definitely not someplace I would recommend or return to.  Maybe it is better during the week when they aren't as busy?
-0xnho-QNSVRAzRVNVdqtw,nvaAUTTl7oqiJDhuimNG6A,SNH5L8QZ4kT9unURQUrYow,4,Another egg-citing way to start off a Monday Morning! Still on a Monday Morning, this place does have a good amount of people. I was craving eggs benedict and ordered their Crab Eggs Benedict. I love this place; it still reminds me of Sunday brunch with the plaid table cloth. Their eggs benedict is large in size. But is it as delicious as the last time? Ah, no it is not. After eating one of the best eggs benedict in New Orleans with real crab, I now see this place as A-OK. It is still very cute and I like the environment. 3.5 stars!
-0xOy45shbLkGL6DNvb35w,KV-yJLmlODfUG1Mkds6kYw,a4LJJU26cSE7k12-0sEw0Q,1,I can't eat here anymore. The food is fine and the bagels are the best in town. The shit attitudes and poor service kill it. Fuck Chompie's!
-0XzoSfwY1dk1T6qexyxJw,VKWwreVZgCMAdGupyRB7Hw,yI15VsYAgcFOoasstMO4UA,3,Also a Marriott girl, and this Springhill did the job. It's close to downtown Tempe where there are abundant restaurants and shops, and is also very close to the airport. Pretty standard with a free breakfast, nice rooms, and attentive staff.
-0yDeuz9ZnTLu-e2uEqzqw,LxNehlnStQY_rxEwiPof_g,uc04YCxFi1ZUj5N9mfiUyQ,4,The food here is good, pipping hot, fresh, and not over spiced or sauced. Location and food prices are great for all you ASU West Campus students, so go take a walk off campus for a change and stop eating in that thing they call a cafeteria! Service and the staff here are great people, make sure to tip handsomely because of this. Although the space to eat is minimal during lunchtime. Today, a huge family decided to take up half of the restaurant, which was very awkward for other patrons. I took my meal to-go today, but sitting in normally isn't too bad. Its not much to look at, but they're for the most part sanitary and efficient at the food and service part.
-0yi7kCqEIUERrgPd9VsOw,wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ,ZUERBXNzvZMGyu02wlIKZg,4,Any place where I can ride a slide to my table AND get to eat BBQ is already ahead of the game.  Great views of the city, and an overall friendly staff, and an overall enjoyable dining experience.
-0YpJmfJJcNa-9OC-9AGJg,7QSYBp2-AOdyUJXEaLnbgA,ITQ8anChFzFdw058JYydWg,4,Tamales taste smokey and awesome.
-0Z8axbnuSc2JJbqc2lLKQ,18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw,rLtl8ZkDX5vH5nAx9C3q5Q,5,I was looking forward to trying this place for a long time.  The reviews on Yelp were good and I was told by a fellow steak lover that if I wanted a great (not the best) cut of steak at a reasonable price, then Texaz is the place to go.  I went on a Thursday evening and the place was pretty busy.  I was seated right away by a very friendly hostess.  You could tell from the looks of the place that it had been around a while.  I could have sworn my booth was going to fall apart, but it was ok.  The d?cor is a bit eccentric with anything and everything having to do with Texas all over the walls.  All the patrons seemed to be having a good time and enjoying their meals.  There were also plenty of wait staff bustling around.While everything on the menu sounded delicious (but NOT diet friendly), I opted for the filet.  Next time I am going to order the prime rib or the chicken friend steak because I hear those are excellent.  My salad came quickly and was very good.  However, it was a bit odd because it contained diced green olives (which I normally don't like), but I said what the heck and ate it all anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised.  When the steak arrived I was surprised again at the size.  I was expecting it to be much smaller but it was a pretty big cut.  I'm guessing around 8-10oz.  I love it when steaks are cooked in plenty of butter (gross to some people...I know) and I guess this place knew that because there was plenty of the hot, melty goodness all over the steak and plate!  It was soooo good but soooo unhealthy.  It was cooked perfectly and I ate every bite.  The potatoes were just ok but I ate them anyway.  Nothing a bunch of salt and ketchup couldn't fix.  For dessert I ordered the homemade pecan pie and it was probably among the best I have ever had.If you are looking for an upscale steak/bbq joint then this is NOT the place for you.  If you are looking for place with some good meat with good prices and excellent service, then this is the place for you.
-0zlsS4lgDdDW6uKZXk_4w,c0RSs2KYK5Y-ZlSrNq9LyA,hW2XQMGHy5_TW7dnijZR6Q,4,Let's talk about the good things at Moto.1. Beer. The owner (who splits his time between CO and AZ) doesn't mess around with typical beers. You won't find Budweiser
-0_ON7Wg1EodKdbAxgLtCg,4QtD359vkU7Jq8vP0uQEww,hhdbr69SqvIoXc3rMZ-bTw,5,The sauce for the Seafood Choo Chee was absolutely fabulous and I would return just to drink their Thai Tea again!
-1-8jxrbKV3Lw8-pomme4w,vCHHSc3yXsWHiJYuZOb3cw,eNADBi_K1Gr0HQZG8QWJNA,2,Bad Experience!!! I loved the selection of cars they had. I went there yesterday to test drive a lexus is250 used. I fell in love with the car and would of bought it right then and there. But the sales associate Easton McIntosh was terrible!!! If you ever go there please see another sales associate! I have never felt that belittled ever by someone.If your buying a car you should never feel like that. One, its already a stressful situation buying a car. Second, to have the sales associate talk you down and belittle you is so unprofessional. At one point he said to me and my dad; Why are you even here if you cant afford the car. HOW RUDE!!!! Tells you a lot about the company if they have people like that working for them. They were non negotiable. This is my first car and I had 50% cash down payment and he still wouldn't work with me. Ill find another car elsewhere and where they appreciate my business. To bad because I loved the car. If anyone on here knows of another sales associate at this dealership who is willing to work with you let me know
-10yga4Ul7K_a7utsoQ_NA,D09yG6Z3gcsh24Qn7Y4gYA,m7vtKWpZ9wdEQ95wJxrMrg,2,I came here after a grueling evening swim practice so I was really hungry - which means anything should taste really good, right? I ordered the carne asada meal, and I have to say that the service was quick and the food was inexpensive. The meal I got, though, was a disappointment. The beef was very dry and tasteless and the rice was dried out, although the refried beans and the soft corn tortillas were OK. Overall, the meal was unsatisfying and I left quite a bit of the meal unfinished. I may try the place again some day as this may have been an off day for the restaurant, but for now I'll have to give it 2 stars.
-12ZStjt9bWI9mzLRpKCZA,YIcbTOdVuJQ19J2yfzePiw,Yzj9vDCJv92t-WhpO3eniA,4,I cant believe this place has no reviews yet! When you get there you order what you want from a book of different teas...they have a pretty good selection (not as much as some other tea stores). The lady that helped me was very friendly and helpful. Im a huge fan of teavana but I will definitely be coming back here for a couple loose leaf teas that teavana doesnt have! They also have several types of tea already brewed for you to sample, and the lady was nice enough to give me a couple samples of a tea bags to take home.
-14dzW6xXSxc1iNhx8qQxA,_AvHni-xdRHmZ3XfYHwGkg,qaKzkFaZtqWIXCGQ-GStQw,4,L loves this place, because it was one our places that we discovered together.  I remember her thinking the young waiter was cute, but not in a sexual way, because he looked so young. The place has great decor, and experimental food. A tad to trendy for scottsdale, even though scottsdale has wealthy people. L repeated with her sons on her own. So, if she takes her sons there on her own, it gets her stamp of approval.
-152Egstg5orQara5jKL2Q,PXmR1MgOAWB066XH20HjxQ,zUocCf7E6_y64mDL-3FlSA,2,service was friendly, and prompt. Drinks were large and free refills, which I really appreciated. But as far as the food goes it was pretty average. I agree with some other reviewers who stated that the sauces seem watery, and the veggies seem canned. i had the yellow curry chicken. it's flavor was acceptable, but certainly not the best I've had. HOT was the spice level I requested, but disappointingly the spice level AND the food temp were somewhere around luke warm.food  2 stars
-17Oe1XuR0klpLpDRAcxWg,kfscAJnLVf6J2uEte7g-5A,7fxHyk4gcfFePv4z7YvgZw,4,Don't let your initial reaction to the buildings in the front discourage you from enjoying Yoli's Cafe.  Hidden behind a house and in a quaint courtyard of other personalized mom and pop stores, Yoli's is a gem in Chandler. Sitting outside we enjoyed large steaming cups of tea and coffee.  One of us enjoyed the Country Omelet while the other had the Garden Skillet with green chilies instead of the peppers.Great food, great atmosphere, great hostess! We were waited on by Yoli and another young lady who were attentive and very helpful.
-181nGtk2h6VKD7M1NK5uQ,XWvht_1ZLdK7EHJ3jo4q0g,N56tE_bSNVAgk59avW-TFA,5,This place was really, really good. So good I would drive from Gilbert to go again. I had the prime rib and it was excellent! The dessert was also amazing.
-1A8PG9EAtIaHKyhY_rNSQ,o9nCXNC14VScabiy2bftgw,I3_WtUjUiQYWht2ZLR2SRw,2,corny spot, but it's next to the hotel and Guiness is on the menu tonight
-1As28MLpaUB12OUV9y8wg,NkTBJP2YOwUAUNzRqR2gJg,G4IR4Mqsg7kFLaruUpAP2A,4,The location is kind of like a hidden gem type of sorts.  The main entrance is in the back atrium of the strip mall with good scenery of passerbys and neighboring restaurants.  I'm definately going to check this place out for the happy hour $5 glasses of vino and 1/.2 apps is a deal that can't be beat.  The food is pretty good and the presentation is pretty right on.  The feel of the restaurant initally is date night feel while lunch is more relaxed and laid back.  Nery has always been there to greet us and the support staff/server has been always very coridal.  I've only stopped in twice but I'll definately be back for more.  I've ordered the fish special both days and the balance for a light yet hearty dish has hit the spot everytime.  The homemade bread is AMAZING.  It is a biased opinion only because the bread smells, tastes and presents like the bread I'd make with my grandmama.  Totally good stuff.  I'll be back again and again!
-1bPsOIVVNPW3fo_j2_Y5g,STv-ED3M2xmRFMSvQbWGaw,PVbcpvrSKv2GTBK9QiQgiA,4,Big sandwiches.  Big.Bread is great on a good day and fair when they don't have it fresh.Mom loves the Philly cheese-steak.I like the Italian.  I always ask for hot peppers.Ordering and paying can be a bit confusing.  Best thing to do is to order and immediately go to the cash register to pay.  Otherwise you have your sandwich, you're hungry and then you have to go pay.  I'm not sure how they dont get ripped off.  It would seem to me it would be easy to order
-1BtzHpnrzzIqll1AKUXwg,hBHkHYOk_E-6EgObC6MTdQ,0JC7aBkxhV8by4iVGCU5Wg,5,This is a favorite destination dining experience. The extensive gardens on the grounds and the pastoral picnic picuresque arboretum are worth the slightly expensive bakery treats and sandwiches.
-1C4a_s47TvXfJUwHA1bvQ,cBpJIOrVXotDI0XAZH_k0g,HtxNcRQr28JTzXPOf7X_fA,4,I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants, even upscale ones like the Yard House. However, I am a fan of the Yard House, and here's why: First, the beer selection; if you're a fan of craft beers like I am, you will appreciate the dozens of craft beer offerings, many of which I have never tried. The Bear Republic IPA was my favorite of the night. Second, the menu is interesting and the food flavorful. I had egg rolls and lettuce wraps; both were in Asian-fusion style and wonderfully flavored. Third, though some reviewers have complained about price, for Monday Night Football they have all-night happy hour, with half-priced beer, appetizers and pizza. You can order appetizers and eat Tapas style while you watch the game from a large number of big screens. With beers, my bill was only $25. Lastly, the service was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and quick. How many places have a waitress that can and will talk about the relative merits of craft beers, suggest one over another, give you just long enough to decide then come back to take your order?  Sandra, you rock!
-1CLWkauqmJNkDas3zuCug,VXuvmtDipL_WRwc0NTM3iQ,ykTUd9nIYDkQYhpntgcTVw,3,The teriyaki and arizona bowls are good!
-1D24b7wJfzT3gbreQoSsA,z3yFuLVrmH-3RJruPEMYKw,8_iqKtRAgZkmT3Su9-HGhg,5,I love this place. The crew is fun to chat with and pick on just a little. The foods are wonderful, and how can you not love a place with a case of beautiful, delicious meats?
-1d5oxrJbL3UNint7Be3vA,OXwKBaV74IM_VduC5OWV1g,HleMgQC2ftqwuqT07rcvqw,3,I have been raised on deep dish pizza since I was a child so I am a huge deep dish pizza fan. When I read about Little Sicily's deep dish on Yelp, I had to try it. It's not bad. I had a take-out order. The girl who answered the phone told me 15 minutes, but when I arrived it took another 15 min or so for it to be ready, which is around the time a normal deep dish usually takes to make. They may have pulled my large sausage and mushroom pan (deep dish) pizza a little early because the crust was chewy and a bit doughy so I put it in my oven for a few minutes, then the crust seemed to be cooked properly.I didn't like the massive amount of garlic in the sauce. I love garlic, but it was way too much. If I didn't know any better, I thought they were trying to help us drive out all the vampires in Surprise. Also, I didn't care for the mushrooms. The mushrooms didn't seem fresh. They tasted like mushrooms out of a can.Overall, the large sausage and mushroom pan pizza was ok. When we get in the mood for deep dish, we will be back. When I took my first bite using a fork and knife (like a good deep dish is always eaten), I thought of Pequod's and Lou Malnati's.
-1D8iJMiDu0BeXnCCVGUHg,PXmR1MgOAWB066XH20HjxQ,DJIwm4UCnM-SOxXbARjPsQ,5,Have a hankering to eat meat from sticks and don't want to visit the county fair? Thai Rama is your place.Of course I am speaking of the chicken satay. Very good with some peanut sauce. I haven't had a whole lot of exposure to Thai restaurants but the few times I have been here, I haven't been disappointed.The menu offers many interesting dishes including a soup served in a flaming bundt cake pan (OK so it isn't actually a bundt cake pan, but  I like to imagine it is). The soup is absolutely delicious, just don't eat the wood floating in it. For seasoning only. You can eat it if you want, just don't come crying to me when you have a mouth full of splinters. I tried a coconut curry stew with chicken and potatoes. I couldn't stop eating it even after I was full. An incredible dish available in varying degrees of spiciness.Might I also suggest you try an iced coffee? I'd have it with or for dessert though. It's so sweet and strong and good that I swore I could almost see through walls when I finished it.The staff is very friendly and attentive and I would recommend Thai Rama to anyone. Even you... I guess.

-1dRhkTge1c1R0ZPw_Rokg,MwaFQkJxzqg8G5_hTip99A,B1xX6JLisfy79sXClSos1A,1,Soooo disappointing! I've been to this one and one in Tucson, same story! Over priced buckets. The crab legs are thin and flimsy. My veggies and potatoes were over salted with chunks of sea salt!! Yuck!
-1E97V2DlxaisQAQYiOQfg,4SviSw8uRF0ddj_HxUVnuA,WZCAwPXauKtNoAhHK2-pCA,5,Not impressed.  Service was slow, food was bland, and the annoying manager kept coming over to our table to tell us lame stories.But really - thanks again Thomas for the wonderful evening.  The Patron shots were great, the wine was great, the food was great.  Coincidentally, if you have a hard time reading one of the comment cards, it was probably my drunken chicken scratch.
-1EcHy8KW-Z3ziTfhd9enw,UKgSs_SJzW9fu4CwhIV1yA,rdGA5FcAvp77uyogM0dQ1Q,5,We stayed at the Firesky Resort over 4th of July weekend...and we were not disapointed! We brought our 2 dogs (our main reason for staying at this hotel) and we were more than surprised to learn that your dog is allowed anywhere on the resort, except for in the pool! The grounds are gorgeous...the pools are refreshing & the drinks are strong! They put anyone with dogs in a reserved wing of the hotel, and it was funny to see so many dogs in one place! They host a daily wine reception in the lobby, where they invited us to bring our dogs to (and we did!) It was nice to stay in a resort where our entire family felt welcome. I will definitely be returning to the Firesky!
-1EJgsBleZV_vK_tSPP8yg,uEJQSIjWui-TDWXaGlcqyQ,NrMU4Qs8qqIZ536buLYQ8w,4,Only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is a few nitpicks about my meal.  It was good though and I will go again.  But read on.*Service:  TOP NOTCH!!  From the moment I walked in the door the girl that noticed me walk in jumped up and came on over..gave me a couple options of where I wanted to sit, I chose to sit at the bar.  They set me up with a tasty sweet tea right away.  Delicious it was.  My waitress was attentively awaiting my order
-1eT7oBrWWd6lhT3Xw7DEw,Bc4DoKgrKCtCuN-0O5He3A,WxQysGZlxxfVXy73ldm5EA,5,Sweet Republic makes the best ice cream in America, as far as I'm concerned. I've been to the place several times and I have never had anything which was less than amazing. Everything is made in the store, from ice cream to sorbet to cookies and waffle cones.Both of the owners are wonderful people who clearly have a passion for making and sharing great ice cream. They also use as many local ingredients as possible. Recently, I've enjoyed Peaches & Cream ice cream made with fresh peaches from a local farm.Also, Sweet Republic as come up with some flavors which one wouldn't think to put into ice cream, but at this place, different is magic. Jalapeno Avocado, Bacon and Guinness are all flavors I've had here.But, Sweet Republic also brings the magic to common flavors and does them brilliantly. Their Belgian Chocolate is to die for if you're a chocolate lover and their Mocha sorbet is fantastic. Finally, the pinnacle of Sweet Republic's flavors is the Salted Butter Caramel. A true description of the taste of this ice cream is really impossible, but it is wonderful.

We were in Phoenix for a quick weekend and I had neglected to do any Yelp research before leaving, so when my bf found M&S from the concierge we decided to give it a go.  We had been disappointed with our last experience at the one in Dallas so I was mainly just hoping to have my hunger satiated so I could go to bed.I was very pleasantly surprised.  We were hungry so ordered what felt like tons of food (don't judge!).  The mussels and bruschetta to start were great!  The mussels were small, the way I like them, and the sauce/broth/bread soak they were in was amazing.  I had the halibut stuffed with a bunch of stuff as suggested by our server, bf had the dover sole, both were good, but that dover sole was amazing!!!!  very light and perfectly cooked.  I wish I could cook fish like that.We finished with some kind of passionfruit mousse dessert that was SO good.  I almost took another one to go.The service was great.  I would go back to this M&S location anytime I was in town.
-1f_I_gp3ugKvJ3iWjHvBQ,FV0BkoGOd3Yu_eJnXY15ZA,dwiis_5YagRG7Ol8JSH-Ig,3,if you're into heavy, rich food, Cowboy Ciao is your place.  i wasn't thoroughly impressed with the food, but the service is good.  very welcoming hostess, if i do say so myself.honestly, i'd rather walk around the corner to fnb - it's way better.
-1gKJG6nADO7Rs7ec3YHbQ,k8JnZBspVOI8kLcQek-Chw,ayklaXnWz-5lRMqm8SR-Yg,1,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE:I have been a long term customer --- Always a cheese or sausage and two pieces of  cheese cake and chicken wings. Last night my wife wanted KFC - so I went there and got her meal - I called Mamma Mia from KFC and said I would like two slices and a cheese cake ---- the girl said we don't take orders for slices over the phone. Are you kidding? She said it was a rule and it had something to do with being ready for walk in customers. I said I am a customer. I explained that I had my wife's food with me and I did not want to wait for the slices as sometimes it is not that quick and I didn't want her food to get cold. She then gave me another girl - who said the same thing - the manager Chris was out. I asked her to have him call me. No call back - and I called back twice for him and he was always out. I cannot believe that they would be so customer unfriendly and cannot believe they have some silly rule about not being able to order slices over the phone - I guess that includes cheese cake. That is ok ---- I went to Spinatos which is much better. Mama Mia has lost my business of the last ten years ------ I am out of there.CHRIS MAYBE YOU SHOULD RETURN A CUSTOMERS CALL - THE OWNER SHOULD FIRE YOU. MAYBE YOU DONT KNOW WHO I AM.
-1hi_v9STqOsZOm_dXWytA,P2zgRMywotyalwFGFwAJZw,uWqaFLpcHkwBq3ht0u1XeA,5,I saw the name Hyatt, then I saw the price of $75 after taxes and fees, and something just didn't add up. We check in and the front desk attendant was extremely courteous and helpful. We walk into our room and are simply amazed. You will have a hard time finding a better hotel for the price of this one. Large room, very sheik trendy decor. the sofa in the living room looked like something out of a trendy art deco store, not something that would normally contain a sofa bed! the kitchen area was a bonus, and dining/desk was great. The 50 LCD TV was amazing
-1I1JlxG3lZs6aLFVI1uHQ,6Lo25bdGe3qEdFLGygBsPw,RxfFQxUtSIGYwTKU_rvAeg,5,I really love this studio! A few months ago, I purchased a Living Social deal that covered 20 classes in a three month period. This new studio is located in a small strip mall at the corner of Osborn and 7th Ave, a few doors down from the video rental store. I live in the Park Central neighborhood and it takes me 5 minutes to walk over. The studio itself is small but decorated in a way that makes it seem intimate. Very, very cute. Kim is the owner and also leads the majority of the classes (she recently hired another instructor). There are four types of classes: Barre Fitness, Ball Pilates, Vinyasa Flow Yoga and Equilibrium Yoga. I have only been to the first two and they are a total blast. Kim plays upbeat music (usually hip-hop, R&B, or rap) that makes the classes go by quick. She has a great attitude and is alot of fun. The studio's website is kept very up-to-date and lets you know which classes are full. The dates go out pretty far, too, which is great because the classes get full fast! For that reason, I am grateful for the added instructor (Jordan). Also, Kim added more Barre classes because it is so popular. My Living Social voucher is going to end soon but I am definitely going to buy a package. A 5 class pass is $60 and 10 class pass is $110. That is comparable to other local spots and you can purchase them online! Love, love, love this studio.
-1I5xYyuciqxqrzbejsVkA,EqyNGesG22jNfNT5pmfYgw,4IyaLc7OEWu-9FSOQUPDmw,4,I have been going to Shangri-La for years and I am still a big fan of their food. First of all, the egg rolls, very good. My mom and step-dad usually get the mixed vegetables or the chicken chop suey and are happy with their meals every time. When I go I usually rotate between the Amazing chicken, Lemon Chicken or Beef and Broccoli. All three are yummy dishes. I like that they do allow substitutions on veggies, unfortunately on some of those veggies there is an additional cost for adding extra veggies. I have also had the mushu chicken, the wonton soup and the duck (I can't remember the name of the dish), they were an experiment not quite to my tastes but I do know others who have eaten those dishes and liked them a lot. I guess it just comes down to personal taste. This is a great restaurant with friendly service for the most part. Once or twice a server had been working on my table that was less than attentive but overall, this is a restaurant I would go to over and over again. In fact, I'm getting hungry just thinking about their food. Hmm..maybe I'll go get some Chinese now.
-1ICyzhnJf5IJpFn0s9GUQ,5U8tIBprXfTYCKzMLlIA7w,DWswYjx1cBNOCW48MlFF_A,4,I am so glad this place opened in Surprise! I am a fan! My favorite is the shredded beef taco and California burrito. The guacamole is pretty good too. You get tons of food and it won't burn a hole in your pocket.
-1IwhkLBqq47VcQnOVum7w,jJhNOhuGpIsJX5SEUFFWYQ,jNSOQGFKm8LaeJEa997Huw,3,Teds is a good place to go with friends. They grill all of your food fresh in front of you, and have a cool way of cutting up the dogs as they're cooking. I wasn't a fan of their white hots, however I can't fault them, as I've never had them before. I may just hate veal! Their regular hot dogs and brats are spot on, and tasty. The onion rings are hand made, and are also pretty tasty. If you do stop by, make sure to get a chocolate milk shake. It's one of the best in the valley (trust me, i'm fat!).
-1KDx-u9VihmfBwcFrJgiA,7LGjM8HKJTwqfYU3C7N_0w,Pdwec6sh7VRUGqI-g4OKfQ,5,Wonderful food, decent prices for the quality (entr?es were between $13 and $23). I had the rib eye and my husband the NY strip. They were both delicious and the sides creative and tasty! Good beer selection, wait staff was friendly, overall a good experience.
-1L3NCDkow9JCIUhg8_b1w,j7XuypdW_w935NhjbvKPQw,TtSaKKJ9obIgGTxwr4UK8Q,4,So surprised by this place. I should of known everything would be great by the sheer fact that they have boba. AAhhhh, I looooovveeee boba. Outside of boba, the soup was great! The biggest serving I've ever had in regards to soup. I ordered the miso soup with tofu because I wasn't feeling too adventurous flavor wise. The soup is mostly broth in comparison to veggies, noodles, and protein selection (but keep in mind the size of the bowl). Seaweed salad was put together in a way I've never seen before. It was very artistic. Usually I've only ever seen it just as the seaweed alone. Very cool. I appreciated that they served forks for those of us who are chop stick challenged when it comes to soup and noodles. Will be back!
-1lsEhqBhDdm6P3t6Mm3mQ,QCosRCJ1owLMgaHnXOMqQQ,eX8UgGam79Au-mpYqDQyLg,4,I shop at Fresh & Easy as a treat, not as my main grocery run.  I love the fact that I can get British items (hurray!!) and some other harder to find items.  Love, love, love the 98? produce packs - such a deal!  And their hummus - fantastic.Just started buying their frozen lunch entrees (comparable to Lean Cuisine or Healthy Choice) and was pleasantly surprised at the quality.  Don't buy sundries here - too expensive - but stick with meats, produce, bakery and ready-made items.  You won't be disappointed.
-1LUy2S433vOiKQf2WQfyg,ElqD819zpmOryvsLuzv-Mw,1we2Ru9dwGsREre5QPL9uA,3,Not bad for a sandwich shop. Far superior to Subway.

I got it with chorizo bell peppers and cheddar cheese. It was pretty good and the portion size was big for the price. They had fresh squeezed orange juice too. Not the best breakfast I've had but it was good.
-1muOZNWV2zdN5G5FHRyiA,KTF-E3NfkJy2wiwcgOPyVQ,PvIeWl21RbH7LlK9q7uNXw,5,Had the softshell crab curry and it was the best curry I ever had.  Great environment, service as well.

DO NOT EVER GO HERE THEY SUCK AND I CANT GO COMPLAIN BECAUSE I DONT LIVE in the area so I am really mad.

-1p2JQ3dk4T6ftCag_uiOw,_mt0EQgGCG-qrLy51RnQag,QaILuMnFAYvPWwpCZFSP-g,4,Excellent service.  Our server knew his atmosphere - witty, quick to refill water, gave us extra salsa for our rice without us asking, brought out spicy salsa, and made a lot of observations.My family and I got seated right away.  The margaritas are amazing - about as good as my mom's.  The salsa and free bean dip are mild, but you can request spicier salsa.  Their green salsa, however, is like watery onions - I overheard it tasting like Chinese soup; no noticeable tomatoes or tomatillos.I ordered the seafood (lobster tasting fish and shrimp) fundido which is basically a fatty chimichanga with jalapeno cream cheese and queso.  The queso is just cheese, not queso dip.  The rice and beans are average.  My dad ordered tamales (a no-meat option was good) and they were larger than expected.  These tamales were not normal miniature-sized.  My mom had tacos separated from rice with corn husks so that the tacos would not get soggy.Our total order was around $60, so it was not inxpensive.  I would say that the $6 margaritas and chips and salsa would be worth it just to come here.  The salsa reminds me of Macayo's actually.  None of this canned salsa taste but also none of this authentic watery salsa taste - just Americanized Mexican taste for the food which I love.

-1qgJ0-ArjSVz85hi57aOQ,WQJwpYwEFT_QTR-lFIh5mA,Sw_F6bMsFbXj6-gRVrRd_A,4,I love Yasha!Ok, yeah, it doesn't have the same stuff (like produce) that a regular grocery store has, but it has so much other cool, interesting stuff, you should pop in sometime and explore! They have a bunch of deli stuff I really want to try... soon... soon......And don't forget about Yasha!  My friend and I walk in, slowly taking in the scene, wandering around picking up some fennel tea (turned out to be good!), some hazelnut chocolate crispy treats (we picked it out because of the funny picture of the squirrel on the box, but it turned out to also be tasty!), and then wandered aimlessly a bit more when Yasha himself comes up to us and takes over.Picking up a basket he jovially directs us around the store, asking us what we like, showing us to the frozen foods, the breads, the wines- everywhere! He dubs us with his own names (I forget my friend's name, but I am now Mishka) and he asks us where we're from. When we say 'from here!' he says No! You cannot be from here! Girls from Phoenix
-1RFAB8kYIaGZZQz98_fZg,L2J3JfjXZLnX1rLhWKthqA,Ypz7hxOCnrg8Y8vxHJU-sQ,3,I had a late dinner here after a happy hour in Scottsdale. I had heard such high reviews from several people about the atmosphere, the food, the drinks, everything. I like gastropubs a lot, especially of the Irish decent. They're an aquired taste because they attract the dirty hipster type, I love the hipsters.My first impression was Wow, they fit a pretty big restaurant inside this little place on Mill Ave. My second impression was What the hec is that smell? The entrance smells interesting. not a bad interesting, just different. Where I sat in the back stank of nursing home. It was an older building, that I appreciated, but it stank to high heaven. I didn't order anything to drink but my food was really good. Had the St. Panciro Chicken sandwich. It came on a great big chibata bread bun and the chicken was grilled nicely with jiucy tomatoes and not-to-leafy lettuce. Mixed in was a spicey sour cream and the softest avocados I have ever had. I love avocados on a sandwich and they were wonderful with the chicken. The sweet potato fries were delicious as well, they came with a hot, spicey dipping sauce that was indeed hot and spicey! Make sure you have a glass of water. It was a good experience for what we were looking for for the evening but I cannot say I would go back. Maybe if I was feeling hipster but the smell really turned me off.
-1RFsON-wgWwxZT304h4hg,zp713qNhx8d9KCJJnrw1xA,DVwKNc-gPFe0tGL9hBA6Zw,5,Excellent !!! looked up the place before our trip to Colorado, decided to stop in Phoenix for dinner.  We had a 30 min wait, but it was so well worth it, the food was amazing!!.. the owner was very kind and started us on drinks while we waited for a table.  The staff is very courteous, the food is phenomenal.. the price is a little up there, but then again it's not your local Taco shop, this is definitely gourmet tacos at it's best.  I loved their Shrimp tacos!! and of course their cochinita pibil quezadillas were lickity good.. everything on the menu looks very very good.
-1sIFaleJ_Z-DGBp4jSBXg,5WdUZlkiDYLgPL1OertCUw,mmZk-DnajPfiCDu67CWrKg,5,It is a 110 mile round trip for me, passing who knows how many salons along the way, and it is well worth the drive even during rush hour. Ask for Ray if you want an amazing hair experience. You will go home feeling beautiful/handsome.
-1snUJN8UaMmswQYfQqMQw,Hxo9XLktuI4_cAPNcTuR5Q,zJ2eI-uGtqfUVX1GsyB0Lg,5,So, I've lived in Tempe all my life, needless to say, TSCU has been there for the majority of it. They have only gotten better since my first savings account started there, back when I was a wee lad. I recently had the pleasure of closing a mortgage with this bank to which I can say 'kudos' to TSCU for helping me buy my first residence. They were super helpful and laid everything out for me in easy terms. The situation was pretty atypical though-- After applying for a lender that bank sometimes uses, it dragged on, and I was very nervous I wasn't going to be able to close on the property. The loan officer I was dealing with, actually went all the way up the ladder to see if she could move the process along. Needless to say, the company they normally used, decided to be buttheads and take forever, so she talked the people in charge and was able to get everything financed in house... Booyah. Now I'm happy owner of a nice little condo. This bank is super awesome, they've always been friendly every time I've been in there. As long as you avoid the lunch rush, I've never had to wait more than a minute or two to get to a teller inside. They have 3 drive-thru tellers, so you won't waste any gas sitting and waiting to get helped.
-1sR-2IDrYt5YUJHX5uMMA,sa9heRBSqZdEzNAUBdk2Eg,N69-RgMXqRaZbIBbx2eH2w,1,I am writing a second review, this yelp must think a negative review has a personal agenda.  I assure you, I do not.I went to this place as a walk-in.  I was duped on the pricing (printed brochures and menus post one price but when I was done,  I was told it was higher) .  I witnessed another customer having this problem as she was checking out as well.Regardless, the pedi was horrible.  Toes were cut unevenly, I had polish on the skin, and it was overall, the worst pedi of my life, and for a price that is WAY over the competition in the area.There is a reason this place is empty - women of North Scottsdale won't tolerate this kind of work.
-1sx2ZzcrUw9YW17BqXgLg,PAtgWCLCFRQd_fjnihISOg,hOXXu0S4G4wJWv3cE1Tceg,5,Eat here at least two--three times a month and its always awesome. Food, Bar, Customer service are great. Its a pleasure dining here. Lots of locals from Paradise Valley. Bar is as good a place as any to sit. KISS
-9aqNWVSuNo035EpBpSPuQ,P8YUA2bXP-wD3VOzWqKVyw,I5HMQTACnATuNosbTY3qpw,5,Yum. Got delicious vegetarian fry bread. Basically an open face taco but on yummy navajo frybread. The place is dingy but go ahead and try it.
-9axRi6QsjxNpbwmgIVrIQ,I1rvqU2k5UQGo2lGdY6hyw,yx6D-4itdAdp9HS1QPDeCQ,4,What can I say? I love a good Thai food restaurant. I noted that the restaurant is divey only in that it is tucked into the corner of an aging
-9BOkE_KGtaKVrbIoUcrRQ,2r8jGeuYvMkyP2ik_X-Bxw,gN03qFYysM5DbgjuV6N0QQ,3,I don't know what to think about this house. I remember reading in Mens Health that this restaurant serves up a heavy portion, high caloric fatty foods. But the cheesecake on the marquee drew me in. I was dining with my daughter and have a tendency to try to fatten up my kids, to no avail and to be fair there is a SkinnyLicious Menu.I ordered up the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Shrimp and chicken sauteed with onions, tomato and peppers in a very spicy Cajun sauce on top of fresh linguine. $17. Certainly a heavy plate, delicious and took home half of it for someone else in the family. My drink was a Stella Artois 22 oz. $7.25 The kid got a marinara pasta. $11.50We came for the cheesecake. Kahlua cocoa coffee $7. and the fresh strawberry  $7.50. I ate half of mine. It was so good.
-9CUDBbZ11brN7TpZMiobw,LBskB7ACUPV8xxjBPKnxmA,hn5bgMW0Zy3MNdFNw_tjOg,4,Food was good, nice decor. People seen to bag on the service. It was a little slow but the  food was fresh. Wait staff & hostess were really nice and friendly. We will be back!
-9cUsJucbiekM4LABNYTYg,vvA3fbps4F9nGlAEYKk_sA,4DsUW5yuIkUcZ9Eu7p7EuA,4,I ordered the special which was recommended by the waiter and it was great.  My wife had the fish which was very good too but maybe too much lemon.  The atmosphere is great.  It looks like an old school Italian restaurant.  They have a lot of photos of celebrities so I guess famous people like to eat there too.
-9eg06EPs7GIGmV0O4gb6Q,nvaAUTTl7oqiJDhuimNG6A,oCFQmDotqcyIYAY1JyKUPg,2,Lackluster, flavorless breakfast. Do not go out of your way to come here. I was shocked at how many people were waiting to eat here. I ordered the poached eggs with toast and potatoes. They overcooked the eggs; a place with the word EGG in the title should be able to properly poach an egg. The potatoes were very basic and sad. The bacon my dad ordered was fatty and kinda undercooked. The big killer is that the prices were more expensive than a diner yet the quality of the food was the same.
-9F5EWQ8DdyHS-zcoLoJMw,R3UFldNkrGqOsDgD_cw6bA,T-f_cOhjSNmlWtSpLHIhFg,4,This place wasn't exactly what I had in mind when I set out to find Caribbean food....but we made the best of what we got. The food was good and the service was fast...but this is more fast foody than sit down since you do order at the counter and then they bring out the food. This is sort of a Hawaiian themed place with rice/noodle bowls and a few sandwiches. The teriyaki saw was to die for and the sweet potato fries were great too. I highly recommend the burger with swiss, teriyake and grilled pineapple.
-9fV4rIf_SQ0tHOpjPlytA,YxLiLBNTm4cOg7OlKKLmVw,O758lrR1X2zI-ySeyjdr6A,4,For a chain restaurant,this place has some pretty good Mexican food!   I typically shy away from chain restaurants when it comes to Mexican food, because we all know you find some of the best Mexican food in a dive!  However, I've been to Arriba's several times and I've never been disappointed.  I love their chimichangas with green sauce and pork!  The chips and salsa are pretty good and the margaritas are excellent!
-9g1u2H6CxRVwgu3a5iPLg,soiGohHtWOltGeomkSxzEw,Z1lPtIHU7bRoIvuVa01H5w,2,I visited a couple times about 25 years ago, when my future wife was infatuated with one of the bartenders. TeePee seemed reasonably satisfying back then and I cant decide if tastes have changed that much or the food has objectively fallen off a cliff. It may be a little of both. Table service was friendly but inattentive, if that makes sense.  Decor is Flintstones meets Happy Days on the Oregon Trail. Or something.  Which would be fun....if the food was edible.  Prices run a buck or two higher than many Mexican chains; again, reasonable only if the food was better. Or even as good, as BajaFresh, Taco Bell or Chipotle. In this industry, there's a thin line between venerable charm and past- its-prime trap, and if you insist on lousy ingredients and dont bother to ask customers how they want their heuvos cooked, then even if your front hostess is a doll, you're on the wrong side of that line.

-9gT82W_GdyPL2N5Wl5R3g,eR2vge978YSyHU-vSLXrvQ,_tYBfde1tz-Q-b_bcVzMRw,5,This place is a fantastic collection of talented and unique individuals coming together in a homey space and making a small bright spot of art in the utter bleakness of the Phoenix cultural landscape.   Also, it's really close to the Phoenix Metro, the freeway, many fine drinking establishments, and there is a hotel nearby if you can't get the light rail home after going to too many drinking establishments.  It's like a piece of chocolate, wrapped in chocolate, inside a giant chocolate.
-9HAZdpHsWYJIkhYIGZ6iw,LfKPiwth-lGmCKTxlDoV9g,K2t_85TGaA5gPjsG58FTHg,2,Let's talk about NoRTH... I have been there a few times, okay quite a few and it is really hit or miss. New Years Eve, NoRTH was the place we decided to celebrate. We were a group of 14 and NoRTH lost our reservation. The manager tried to fake that they did not lose our reservation and move us into Bar NoRTH, which is not the same thing by any mean. It was disappointing to say the least. The food is decent and I will say that the Zucca Chips are a must try, along with the Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza. A little hesitant to go back, the location of NoRTH is great with shopping all around, and their wine list is quite strong. I enjoy the spanish cavas offered on the list partnered with an outside lunch on the patio. The weak performance on New Years Eve definitely was a let down, but again the food is a strong hold of this place.
-9hL4dpX07D1L7Z5p6jmQg,JokKtdXU7zXHcr20Lrk29A,16djaKDikBivsWVKtYTchA,5,I am not going to make this long as everyone else who has previously reviewed hits the nail on the head. This is a wonderful place to just relax with your friends. The staff is always friendly and accomadating and the food and alcohol selection is incredible. If you have not tried it yet then you are missing out. BTW though the nacho's are a GREAT deal and can be shared with 2-4 people!
-9h_2VXoOwda0q6or81taQ,V7Da92RVtaWGTL6GNkPT8A,jIHaXo4-KR9kvh2J7eMkIA,4,Clean, cool and the staff was super helpful
-9iMDrKo6uoAQUDaNb6W2A,v68yAIw0gpn15xwtcR_rKg,TTP7l5g4QUVCpQZ9NTAWqw,5,I am not often in this area as a general rule... but my daughter live pretty close, so I always make a detour into Dutch Bros Coffee! I just filled up my first punch card so now I get a FREE coffee next visit! Yay!I always get the hot Latte Breve... so much BETTER than Starbucks!Highly Recommended!

For those wondering, the ice cream tastes cream-flavored and contains chunks of frozen lobster.Every other flavor I've tried here has been comparatively normal and quite delicious. The sundaes are made with generous amounts of sauce. There are sofas, as well as tables, and there are local magazines and free wifi. There is also an adjoining pizza shop, should calories be no object (and a hospital across the street, should a heart attack ensue).
-9JZaH_1vQt8wPYRVwHtgQ,4sW8Z6NLXLRkruSKSKUEUw,A_O8wZOsMTPwyeYA4-Rsow,3,With the mystery user Paul having deleted his review ... and with a return visit I'm adding a star to my previous review.The coffee is still nothing to crow about (try Conspire for the best coffee in town IMHO) but my sandwich was pretty good (but over priced). I just SOOOO want to love this place it almost hurts.Well the interior is stunningly beautiful and it's much improved from what was in the venue before (the dirty hippy coffee shop).
-9kjKMtKfff6Hy5uA-s8Xw,8t80-omyflkywRfu9LPh6g,gMtc0mLCof1pX_YYUrHfwg,5,5 Stars for Happy hour!  They have a late night all summer happy hour menu which mimics the dinner menu. Jesse and Jamie are fantastic bartenders with A+ service!  Get the Crab cake, wedge, or seafood salad ti start, Everything is great here. Only downside is that this is not a place for eye candy so bring a chatty girlfriend or someone you can enjoy great food and convo with.  Definitely a place you can be comfortable sitting at the bar alone or with friends!
-9LdJnb7uxI29S-rgRZtkQ,NN2qs5B713vM6BDcMyrg4A,eF0eSEA-nI27z5P_GtZYTA,5,Great service and outstanding breakfast. What else do you want?! You can even take your pup and eat outside or just have tour cup of Joe. Recommend to anyone in the northern Scottsdale area.
-9N7TV9awLA8bEYH8pUuoQ,JrEQyiUegkF3pXNCfpy0mw,WzAJ6I7ym79iIIM4b8h56w,5,Fast delivery And Fast delivery and good subs
-9nwazBrU0zQGO1fAB-IzA,nFBse3YXN8CP1cDieyLz6A,3y-KR4LC0mZW9-y90iLU8A,5,My son (he's 4) and I LOVE Mojos!  Great tasting yogurt thats not too sweet and is perfectly refreshing.  He loves picking out toppings - I've had to limit him to 5 toppings because he wants to put everything in his bowl!  We often stop by when they have their Facebook special words and you get half off - love that.  The only thing I don't like is that sometimes its a little hard to work the machines to put the yogurt in the cup.
-9NZg2TZCcWI_2FmB52Txw,9VYZA4vEKtT_SXHj-ZK_1Q,aidmFfjOjpVKD-5L4J6X7w,2,Disappointing. When in for an impromptu late lunch, ordered the shrimp and vegetable tempura lunch special. Salad appeared to be the pre-chopped, out of a bag type of salad. If Chipotle and Panda Express can buy fresh vegetables and chop them, why can't a real restaurant? Major pet peeve of mine! Then the tempura arrived and it was heavily breaded
-9oDsSkOYHIeypF7WVc0aw,eTbtfgUtfewdncgVf2CbWw,tVpMSoHnbsODWJzoIIFecA,5,Just yum!!! I love the quiche...the almond croissant makes the plain ones blush....even they are good too!
-9OK-2YIwesbFYXOKuKOwQ,8x9Mzb7gX6SEHQIlSDpU8w,0VNNqpD687meEu70X5knNw,4,The best casino in Arizona. Clean, variety of people, good food, cheap drinks, and okay service. Now, I've never won here but, I'd recommend this place over the other casinos here.
-9OvG1n5R_GtNtvNHRd5ow,MIgONuEZlXLyQ1xwKAwX0A,a2yYBmJxshUSJyDOqio5cg,5,I moved out to San Tan Valley about 5 months ago. Our favourite take out chinese place was Red Dragon in Chandler and since it was too far away, we started looking around for something closer. Luckily we found the China Chef. We have ordered several things for take away as well as ate in and I have not had a single problem with any of the food there. My wife usually orders the General Tso chicken and I mix it up with a different dish everytime. I really like the war wan ton soup as well as the bourbon chicken. The rice is awesome and the noodles are great. The food is so good there, while I wrote this review I convinced myself to order something from them! Oh, and the prices are really good too.
-9OVHwnP7tw8l3BCweSFZg,nqOLgcv4V08BfBYMnC5Bjw,ZzqJuInG9XvzF0EZHtu8bQ,5,Turn It On Electric are pro's. One of the things I look for in any tradesman is neat work. I don't like sloppy wiring, crooked wall switches or little bits of wire all over the place. These guys make sure the job is complete. On top of that they are really knowledgeable and want to do it right. I had Chad take a look at my breaker box which was making some weird noises. There were things in there not done right from years ago, loose connections and code violations. I could have had a fire. Now I have peace of mind that the whole thing has been checked and it's done right.
-9pAxk2Qvv-i4PdKAOr-RA,Jbv39pK_ConiOlS3Rba05g,5GmjjTfQ8eeo5fmKphmp1A,4,Been going here for years, and visited again recently and it was as good as ever! Their lunch specials (salad & pizza) are delicious, well-portioned, high-quality and very fairly priced.
-9pg8PfT44wesFZ28KMIFw,8D_e6Oc4eZdRSnK0_v8sGw,sALB8-F04S9VcZMF_GkGUA,5,Always has what I need, friendly staff.. Clean restrooms.. & a cool place to hang while deciding if the read or mag is worth it over a nice java... I just hate being asked every time if I want to join the B&N program... No.. But.. No.. Ok.. Well.. No..
-9qKmZJ8ZFUPB5-mLFWysg,s5roBvbA79SQaO4FHkJgGw,tCQBZogpMkCZQxpBjVG23Q,4,First time here....thought the decor was adorable, in a historic sort of way and probably exactly the same as it was 35 years ago, when it first opened. Something to be said about that. Why fix what's not broken? Obviously if you are looking for 5 star quality and ambience, this is not the place for you. If you are looking for a friendly, inexpensive restaurant with decent food, a varied menu and nice service, then this is the place. 95% of the menu is made from scratch. The small salad bar is simple and fresh and a nice add-on. The pie slice is humongous. The fresh homemade bread is excellent. The mashed potaotes are real. It's comfort food and fresh pie and that's that. If you want more, you're in the wrong place!
-9QqRlAKuR2oERQNp8iQVg,L-GfuOmn9mv55571uXvf2A,o2-JGW-3pru6IK9o33oRJQ,4,Good stuff! Reminds me of a small pho place in San Jose I used to go to almost everyday for a while.The pho is very good. Not the absolute best, but very good. Their fresh spring rolls are excellent as well. Cool, crisp and tasty. I also like their sandwiches as well, but could do without the tomato in them. Kind of strange.
-9rLHV79vfuWdj6Lgbee1A,qMkIbQFrROSnPaQ7at85-w,MNd2kbG7OYxElc6xe1xexQ,5,The DBG is a very well fun establishment. The garden staff is knowledgable and courteous and the setting is really spectacular. It's a wonderful place to get away alone and they also have a robust schedule of interesting events and music. It's a treasure.
-9RM_cUvBeQtjcjKz3RevQ,ya_ifIN99BuYA25lJDIMxg,IODaFywdVYc5Zeaqrl2SeA,5,Love Dr. Little! He is very patient with both my kitty and me. Answering all my questions and calming any concerns. My cat had a bad experience going to the vet office, so we switched to a home vet. Best decision ever. And we actually had a price reduction this year with his annual visit, yea!
-9Sl3v_5cIlo7hjZ55jn8w,JuBygU4XDjqSeW9okyvbsQ,0-aWamipsRNfcgFYALX1KQ,4,This cafe is really nice! There are windows everywhere and outside they have a patio and grass! Their coffee is a hit or a miss (depending on who makes it), the cupcakes are good, strawberry smoothie is great, and the sandwiches are delicious! Food 4/5
-9T_Gdi3DzmNoTU5-9mLTQ,8t80-omyflkywRfu9LPh6g,uA18GuF_ezOH6tXkrrykbw,4,Great service. Food was a good quality.  The pot stickers were ok. I was a little disappointed.
-9urw0EzQlYp5pTi8up_hQ,rLAeltELaGdQKh_LYIllEA,CtuoM6_Im-xBZMAqPKMQ8A,5,Such a beautiful resort! My parents stayed here over the weekend so we popped over a few times to visit them & check it out. The staff were friendly & very helpful when we had any questions. The rooms are beautiful & pretty spacious. The bathroom is stocked with great products from their spa.The pool isn't large like other resorts in the area, but it's extremely relaxing & peaceful.Thanks to my parents, we'll be back to try T. Cook's restaurant soon!
-9VmcWlqMIlbGBhRnJdWZg,r_0k2yqAo1Z4tg_IgXr7Jg,w6r1V9eOsGrebp2LbpcNzQ,2,This was my first and last time here. I got the Vanilla Bourbon gelato. It was overpriced, and old. It was not creamy, but had started to turn icy. I will go to Enzo's or Angel Sweet instead. (Enzo's has awesome cannoli's)
-9VUB7ygEppPYj0qLD4RlA,NcJ4Ug6EX4t_WBh3E0mXhA,XHz-jSSd8xCOdsVWkf_QZQ,4,Soooo much better than Babies-r-us. Bigger selection, more variety and great customer service.  Really wish we had one in San Diego.
-9WxPMSmWBbQYOwSgd5eWQ,ppoQDk5EQjOJBYNEzYp9Hw,jXp0eFDh_LNO8JfcGlV3pw,4,This Party City location is larger than it looks from the parking lot, and they seem to have everything that will fit your party needs. Be sure to sign up online for emailed discounts and special sales!
-9xfHxKVfZqEeTJZx9HnGA,KUyz0Qe60tov7dkfnzl19w,ZOcrMcjw4pJI1GR2yM3W3A,5,Only three reviews? I just ordered my parts yesterday. Free shipping for anything over $50, very cheap prices for OEM parts. I called after hours and left a message to add an additional part to my order. Customer support is 100%, they called me back the next morning to confirm. My order is updated, processed, and ready to ship! :D
-9xT4ybZ796NTnx98GC82w,FgyBmc-XS_ViFAf8Wy25yA,5_2BuK-IWiuLhZ9VGBRYYw,5,Had so much fun there for our son's birthday in July. Phoenix feels like a mini city coming from San Diego. We had a view of the airplanes coming in from the west and could see the city wake-up to the morning. The kids liked seeing into the highrise office buildings nearby, too.  Room service was so fun with a suprise birthday candle in the cake! There is a suspended pool on the 4th floor that we looked down on and we saw all the furniture blow into the pool when a huge windstorm kicked up. Walking distance to a mall with some decent restaurants if you don't want to dine-in. You CANNOT beat the beds. They are a special brand for these hotels and they are THE selling point for my husband when weighing out the cost of the room!! Very good experience!
-9YeozC18rHeJHj7Cn-biw,nts2OALwvyvfNh9focRZ3w,S_LAaGC89w7oW5SXKQO2tQ,3,Excuse me as this is my first Yelp post, so my details are a bit scattered!  I've been to the Hillside Spot about 3 times and have also turned away a few times b/c it was either too busy on a weekend morning or closed on a night.  More recently my girlfriend and I stopped in and it was very nice.  Quiet, chill, not busy, and a relaxed place for some dinner and a drink.  It is truely from my experience, the only resturant like it in the area as far as attitude, healthy fair, and service.  I had the wings and a Nut Brown Ale and each were pretty good.  My girl had a salad which she though was very good.  I'd say it's not a top notch amazing place but serves its purpose for the area!
-9YNxVQkbLAhGgAQHM4Wug,puFrm8eNizztqaWr_e32pQ,q0KigjVBtb6dfRjX3QJbsQ,4,I think I found my new favorite Thai place, and it's in walking distance to my house! Hooray! I've only tried the chicken pad thai. It wasn't as sweet as other places but I don't like things that are too sweet. I asked for a little spicy and holy cow, talk about spicy! Again, very much enjoyed. Other reviews said the Thai iced tea was a must and that is solid advice; the drink was smokey and sweet and I'm wishing I had another one right now. Also, the portion size was huge so I'll be enjoying the pad thai for the next day or two. Don't be fooled by the run down, cheesy, Las Vegas style strip mall that Lemongrass is in; this place is tasty!

I appreciated that the technician took the time to check my brakes and other things before he finished changing the oil, just so I would be aware of regular maintenance I would need in the future.
-9Y_RNTsDGu8QvY27wd08w,WTxfdir4ZTJLA6aq6N6HzA,IldNKx5L8unlcv3LBSs-_g,3,Pizza doesn't thril me, but this Streets of New York is better than most. The ham and pineapple thin crust was close to perfect (but canadian bacon costs twice as much as ham??). It did suffer a bit from underdone middle

Its the best thing to happen to quiet arcadia...lol...its nice to have a late night lounge in the area because there is really only scottsdale for night life...its not too crazy but its a good time...decent drinks its just very small...i like the outdoor area in the back!

-MwoyKtsg-7BIzlWig5Nlw,fPExBO1aXA5c4uwlHFyx2Q,caELu3OqZm8LkdikpmEB4w,5,Hands down the best neighborhood Italian restaurant in AZ. The veal, chicken and pasta dishes are all amazing. One of the best salads in town as well. The bar menu is one of the best deals as well, tons of food for not a lot of money. They also pour a great glass of wine.
-MZFdK6kiFqCcz-4R4RB-A,FCcFT610nQBVcRdY-devQA,A99dyhEqcd_yXKPfBWeZHA,3,I still like this place... this being the 5th time I've come here.  I wrote this update as this was the first time I actually tried something that wasn't the Vintage Burger or the Charcuterie Board and wanted to share my opinions:- Warm Brie: ok portion of cheese, though hummus was meager and I think the grilled vegetables could've been more grilled and grilled-looking (as in grill marks
-NwcJxlr-4gyMF1EEFUMwQ,oajNY_oTIMb7YZsor7Xonw,-88wExFtc-abvLzu57VsFw,5,The one thing keeping me going when I drove across the country to San Diego was knowledge that I had 1st row behind home plate tickets for the Padres spring training game.  For my first trip to Spring Training, I had an awesome time at the Peoria Sports Complex.  It was super easy to get great seats, and my 1st row ticket only cost $28.  Not bad for living the life of luxury sitting next to the Padres brass.  I particularly enjoyed watching Omar Minaya have to consult the media guide to read the bio on each Padres prospect that took the mound or came up to bat.  Good to know our highly compensated club VP is really on the ball.  The stadium had a decent selection of craft beers, but I had to walk to the outfield to get it.  When you are sitting in King's seats behind plate, you don't want to trudge out to the outfield with the plebians to get a Fat Tire Dig, but sometimes you have to swallow your pride for a quaffable oat soda.  A real bonus of coming to Peoria was the In N Out literally two blocks outside of the parking lot exit.  A real anti bonus is that things in Phoenix are way further apart than they look on Google Maps.  It took me 35 minutes to get to Peoria from the Scottsdale W I was staying at.  Oh well, Padres spring training was worth it, even if they lost.
-nzgr_22FX-9qUvNf5kTWw,7cP7WFmWiTVh-raIL3N_Vw,cRyNICH0mhjxagvSyVr60Q,4,I must be dreaming, 'cause this place is just too cool. Tucked in side an easy to miss house with a barely noticeable sign even during the day, find yourself sipping down a bottle of your favorite libation or have them pour you a locally brewed craft right out of their ice cold taps. Like many of the stops along Roosevelt in Downtown, The Roosevelt elevates the cool of the area by a factor of ten.After having one too many and falling into a happy stupor, I slipped back tipping myself off the edge of the seat. I must have gotten quite the knock on the head. Waking up dazed, confused, and aimlessly wandering about Roosevelt Row in downtown. That must have just been a weird dream I am awaking from. How on earth did I arrive here? and why am I so hungry? I wondered. Good thing the Roosevelt is just down the way
-OawZRl3-3bpMCUybV_rHg,o_w69y1M6pkKetd1w43i_w,kom_byw9fPdVzw7Mw_C4HQ,4,Hard to find real Italian food in Arizona.  Let's face it everyone can claim it, but hard to match NY style Italian.  Brio, being a chain itself, rises above the other chains and offers some higher quality Italian cooking.My wife always gets the whole roasted chicken which *is* really good.  It's some of the best restaurant chicken I've had.I'm partial to trying something different each time I come here, sticking with some pasta dish (heck I can get a steak somehwere else).  The ala Vodka dishes are great and anything with prosciutto is tasty.This is a great place for small-ish date night group of friends.  Service is always good for us, selection is consistent with specials when you want them and the quality of the food has been excellent for me each time.Tip: check out the happy hour times to save some cash :-)
